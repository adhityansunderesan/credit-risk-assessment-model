📊 Credit Risk Assessment & Scoring Model
Case Study: Infosys
🔍 Project Objective

This project evaluates the creditworthiness of Infosys under an assumed ₹200 Crore term loan exposure.

The goal was to simulate a structured bank-style credit assessment using financial ratios, weighted scoring, and stress testing.

🧮 Analytical Framework

The evaluation was conducted in four stages:

Financial Ratio Analysis (3-Year Trend)

Weighted Credit Scoring Model

Downside Stress Testing

Qualitative Risk Assessment

📈 Key Financial Indicators (FY2025)
Metric	Value	Interpretation
Debt-to-Equity	0.085	Extremely low leverage
Interest Coverage	94x	Strong earnings cushion
EBIT Margin	~24%	Stable operating performance
Free Cash Flow Margin	~20%	Strong cash conversion
Current Ratio	2.11	Comfortable liquidity
🧾 Credit Scoring Result

Final Weighted Score: 4.5 / 5

Risk Classification: Low Credit Risk

The borrower demonstrates strong solvency, profitability stability, and substantial cash resilience.

⚠️ Stress Testing Summary

Three downside scenarios were simulated:

Revenue decline of 20%

Revenue decline of 15% with margin compression

Severe stress: 30% revenue drop & reduced margins

Even under severe stress, interest coverage remained above 40x, indicating high financial resilience.

🏢 Qualitative Risk Considerations

Exposure to global IT spending cycles

Dependence on US and European markets

Potential client concentration risk

Currency sensitivity

Overall business risk assessed as moderate but manageable.
